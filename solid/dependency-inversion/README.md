# (D)ependency Inversion principle(DIP)

- High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

# High level vs low level module

- Whether a module is high or low level is relative, it can be both high and low. High level modules usually command low level modules to do tasks.
